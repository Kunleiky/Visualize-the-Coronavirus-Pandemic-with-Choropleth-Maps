# Visualize-the-Coronavirus-Pandemic-with-Choropleth-Maps
I am a huge advocate for data visualizations because I believe that it is the most effective method to illustrate and explain complex information, especially numerical data, in a simple and digestible manner. Also when performed properly, visualizing data can reduce or help mitigate bias in data interpretation. One of my favorite types of visualizations is animated choropleth maps. Given that there’s a pandemic going on right now, I thought that now would be a good time to demonstrate the power of animated choropleth maps.

# Visualizing the Coronavirus Pandemic
The data that I used to create the following visualizations is the Novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is a composite of multiple sources including the World Health Organization, National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, and the United States Centers for Disease Control.
Note: If any one of these sources fails to provide accurate and timely data, the visualizations may be skewed or inaccurate.
