# Visualize-the-Coronavirus-Pandemic-with-Choropleth-Maps
I am a huge advocate for data visualizations because I believe that it is the most effective method to illustrate and explain complex information, especially numerical data, in a simple and digestible manner. Also when performed properly, visualizing data can reduce or help mitigate bias in data interpretation. One of my favorite types of visualizations is animated choropleth maps. Given that thereâ€™s a pandemic going on right now, I thought that now would be a good time to demonstrate the power of animated choropleth maps.
